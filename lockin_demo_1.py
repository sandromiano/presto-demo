"""Demonstrate simple use of multifrequency lockin measurements

Drive some signals with different detuning from df and measure
the effect of this detuning with a multifrequency sweep.

Normally Lockin.tune can be used to make sure that all frequencies
are tuned to df, but in this example detuning is used to generate
something interesting in loopback.

Connect output port 9 to input port 9, optionally monitor output
with oscilloscope on port 10.
